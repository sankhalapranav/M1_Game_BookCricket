After winning the toss, the player has to select whether he has to bat/bowl first. \nThe player who is going to bat first, need to hold the book. \nHe has to randomly open the pages of the book and look for the last digit of that page number which is nothing but the runs obtained in that particular ball. If the last digit is 7/8/9, then it will be considered as a dot ball. \nThe obtained score will be added to the batsman's score everytime. \nThe batsman will be out if the number is 0. Then, the second player has to play with the book in the same process.");
